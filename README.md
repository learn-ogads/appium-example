# Usage
This is an example project automating Instagram with Appium.

You'll need to change the username you'd like to send a message to in `main.py`.

# Requirements
You'll need Appium installed and running in the background for this program to work.

When running Appium you'll need to specify the base path to use. In this case we went with `/wd/hub`. You'll need to update the target DeviceDriver in `main.py`.

This script was meant as a very basic example that could be extended upon.
